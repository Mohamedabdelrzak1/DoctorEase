# DoctorEase API Project

Welcome to DoctorEase, a scalable and modular web API built using ASP.NET Core Web API for clinic and medical appointment management. This project focuses on providing core functionalities for a clinic management system, including patient management, booking system, medical articles, testimonials, and medical cases with image uploads.

This API is designed with clean architecture principles, repository pattern, dependency injection, and JWT-based authentication to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.
